{"Questions":[{"Question":"Which best describes the way Nmap undergoes network mapping?","Explanation":"Nmap initiates a three-way handshake with systems in a network, before purposely not conforming to the TCP standard to get a response from a system.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"By pinging all IP addresses on a network.","Correct":false},{"Text":"By analysing traffic moving across a network to track active hosts.","Correct":false},{"Text":"By initiating a three-way handshake with systems.","Correct":true}]},{"Question":"Which of the following is not true?","Explanation":"UDP port scanning can be slower than TCP port scanning as it may be difficult to get a response from some services.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"TCP port scanning can involve sending a packet to all 65536 ports.","Correct":false},{"Text":"UDP port scanning is faster than TCP port scanning.","Correct":true},{"Text":"If no reply is returned, it can be assumed that the packet was filtered or that the port is closed.","Correct":false},{"Text":"None of the options.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"The strcpy() function in C is:","Explanation":"The function strcpy() is used in C to copy a string into another variable. It is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks as it does not ensure that the lengths of both inputs are the same length. Therefore, if a string is copied into a variable that has less memory allocated to it, the CPU will override excess memory with the string's characters.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Safe to use when trying to copy strings due to its in-built checks.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Dangerous to use without input sanitisation.","Correct":true},{"Text":"Can protect against buffer overflow attacks.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Both safe to use and can also protect against buffer overflow attacks.","Correct":false}]}]}
